# CrewDeck Changelog

Every published CrewDeck release is documented here and copied into its GitHub release notes.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Local-time-zone meetup scheduling so every member sees dates, availability, and start times in their own time zone.
- A long-term unavailable option that blocks upcoming meetup dates until the member turns it off.

### Changed

- Redesigned Ideas Board cards make vote totals, authors, statuses, and actions easier to scan.
- The Ideas Board guide now appears only on the Ideas Board.
- Crew Directory presence indicators now stay aligned with profile pictures.
- Captain meetup reports use the same local-time conversion as member calendars.
- Electron, Vite, and supporting build packages were updated to patched versions.
- Privileged database functions now use a private schema with narrow public entry points.

### Removed

- The CrewDeck GitHub Wiki and its documentation-only preview resources.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Person-to-person meetup invitations with accept and decline actions.
- Full-day and partial-time availability controls with clear calendar colors.
- A dedicated reports workspace in the Captain panel.
- Interface scaling, high contrast, stronger focus outlines, underlined links, and larger-control accessibility options.
- A startup sequence that reliably appears whenever CrewDeck launches.

### Changed

- Crew-to-crew meetups now confirm when the invited member accepts; Captain approval is only required when the meetup involves the Captain.
- Meetup notifications now go to the people involved instead of routing every request through the Captain.
- The Ideas Board explains its posting, voting, and status flow more clearly.
- Support tiers now explain what contributions help cover instead of promising perks.
